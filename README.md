# Docker Magento 2 Development Environment


### Intro
This development environment has been in testing for the last four months. It was developed by me after digging through Inchoo's blog (https://inchoo.net/magento-2/development-environment-magento-2-using-docker/)

After consulting Clean Docker (https://github.com/clean-docker/Magento2)

After consulting ManBee Docker (https://github.com/meanbee/docker-magento2)

And after looking over several other Docker environments. I took small pieces from each one until I could get a stable, repeated install on a variety of enviornments.

The use case for these was in a wide multi-client environment where it was common to have very unusual clients and needed large swaths of variables from MariaDB to Mysql 5.6, 5.7 or Percona. 

This is the most stable build.

I do not take any credit for the bin/ commands I took those from Mark Shust
 (https://github.com/markoshust/docker-magento/tree/master/compose/magento-2/bin)

They are short and sweet and it seemed silly to rewrite something already written by another developer.

Note that these instructions assume you already have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed.
